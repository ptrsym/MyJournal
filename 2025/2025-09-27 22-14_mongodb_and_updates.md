Later entry than I would have liked - haven't really been in a great headspace but we need the move on. Right now I have two coding projects to work on that I've put off a bit. My Java Tetris app is mostly done and I just need to configure animations and sounds for some final touchups...I'll try and do that on Monday as I need to start making proper headway on my ChatApp. This app uses MEAN stack and is mostly frontend implemented at this stage. It isn't professional grade but we do what time allows and mostly focus on the concepts. I'd imagine I could build something from scratch more appropriate for some portfolio and/or actually just work on this one with updates when I'm not under time pressures to fully flesh out concepts....anyway. The focus of this entry is mostly what I've been doing today which is trying to logically plan out how I'm going to refactor my code to use a MongoDB. It seems a lot easier to just implement than previous RDBMS that I used (SQLlite). I'm going to start by copying my models over the the collection -> add the server API calls on the server side annnnnd then go through and change all methods that handled localstorage implementations to make requests to the server... then apparently build handler functions for those request methods to handle UI changes/redirects etc. We'll see how it goes. I give myself a day to do this and figure it out properly.

Fitness/Health notes and goals... still been slacking on being gym consistent. I feel physically healthy and strong but I'm just not in the headspace to go somewhere and be alone with my thoughts for 90 minutes at this point. I need new music and a better mentality. I'll try to keep this entry positive so I'll avoid addressing it. Diet wise I'm at 1-2 meals a day...likely losing weight still which isn't great but as long as I can maintain a base level of strength without atrophying too much I'll take it and correct it later. I still havent done my second Russian session yet with my current workload stressing me out. I want to make it a routine so keep postsed for hearing about that one. Hopefully I can do an hour every other day initially and work more into it as I gain momentum...hopefully. 

That's all for now.
