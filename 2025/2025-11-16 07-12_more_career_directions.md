# more career directions

So recently I've been in the usual limbo of building roadmaps and study plans as I sit at these crossroads. I'm trying to make my days productive but the overall stress of uncertainty is taking its toll. I'm mostly fearful of committing time into some direction in IT that is not at all where I want to go. I'd really like to leverage my ENGINEERING degree and work as an actual engineer. To do this I've been re-evaluating some of my interests and doing more research in potential roles and directions I could take. As of now I've drafted another roadmap focusing on controls engineering, but I've also watched some content on embedded systems and that still holds my interest too as a potential pivot. The reality is I just want to use the next 3 or so months to strengthen a skillset for the industry I want to step into and my FIRST preference is one of these fields. I'm going to leave this roadmap here again with the others so I have something to step back and refer to.

-----------------------

3‑Month Crash Course Plan (Controls Engineering Focus)
Month 1 – Orientation
- PLC Basics
- Learn ladder logic and structured text.
- Tools: OpenPLC Project (free simulator), Siemens LOGO! Soft Comfort demo.
- Resource: EIT Certificate Course in PLCs & SCADA.
- SCADA Basics
- Understand dashboards, alarms, supervisory control.
- Tools: Node‑RED (open source), Ignition SCADA trial.
- Resource: Free SCADA Training for Beginners.
- Industrial Protocols (Intro)
- Read about Modbus TCP and OPC UA.
- Resource: Schneider Electric Industrial Automation Training.
- Goal: Be able to explain how PLCs, SCADA, and protocols fit together.

Month 2 – Hands‑On Practice
- PLC Simulation Project
- Build simple ladder logic programs (motor toggle, conveyor belt).
- Resource: OpenPLC tutorials and GitHub examples.
- SCADA Visualization
- Connect PLC outputs to Node‑RED dashboard.
- Add basic alarms (e.g., “motor overload”).
- Protocol Familiarity
- Implement Modbus TCP between PLC simulator and SCADA dashboard.
- Resource: Modbus guides on Control Engineering blogs.
- Goal: Create a demo system where a simulated PLC controls an actuator, and SCADA shows its status.

Month 3 – Mini Project
- Tank Level Control System Simulation
- PLC logic: Pump turns on/off based on sensor threshold.
- SCADA dashboard: Displays tank level, pump status, alarms.
- Documentation
- System diagram, ladder logic screenshots, dashboard interface.
- Upload to GitHub as “PLC + SCADA Demo Project.”
- Goal: Have one concrete project demonstrating controls engineering fundamentals.

Checklist of Skills & Tools
- [ ] PLC Programming: Ladder Logic, Structured Text (OpenPLC, Siemens LOGO!)
- [ ] SCADA Systems: Node‑RED, Ignition demo
- [ ] Industrial Protocols: Modbus TCP (priority), OPC UA (awareness)
- [ ] Simulation Tools: PLC simulators, SCADA dashboards
- [ ] Documentation: Diagrams, READMEs, GitHub portfolio

Embedded Systems Competency Brush‑Up
To strengthen your graduate profile alongside controls engineering:
- C & C++ for Embedded Systems
- Resource: Coursera Embedded Systems Courses.
- Resource: Embedded Systems Engineering Roadmap (GitHub).
- Microcontroller Ecosystems
- STM32 (ARM Cortex‑M series), Arduino, Raspberry Pi.
- RTOS Basics
- FreeRTOS tutorials (official docs + YouTube demos).
- Toolchains
- Keil µVision, STM32CubeIDE, GCC toolchains.
- Version Control & Documentation
- Keep GitHub projects updated with clear READMEs and diagrams.

Aside from that I've been consistent with my language study, learning a little bit every day and finding more resources. I'm getting better/faster at reading cyrillic and remembering more vocab... but I need to make more headway on grammar so I can actually start constructing sentences in my head and speaking. I'm pretty motivated towards this goal and often find myself putting off other things to just mess around with this. I think i need more scheduling structure to make sure it reamins focused.

Fitness wise my cardio has come a long way. I feel the best when I'm actually doing stairs as I run my flashcards at the same time for maximum productivity. Just a few weeks ago I was getting pretty tired at 15 minutes but yesterday I was on there for an hour. It's nice to watch progress improve for something and 'number go up'. My lifts are getting back into form again and I'm feeling stronger/looking as I usually do again. Some minor shoulder strain I need to be careful but otherwise been feeling good about that. Hoping it carries over to other areas of my life.
