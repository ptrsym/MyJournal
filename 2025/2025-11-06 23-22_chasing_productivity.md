Been exhausted last few days so havent made too much study progress. Watching a few videos here and there to keep my finger on the pulse while I refocus my energy. Found a video on cloud engineering. The reality is I figured out that I need to position myself to specialise in something. I restructured my plan in the previous entry to train some data engineering concepts but I'm saving this here to revisit this eventually if I havent figured out a clear direction yet. To be honest I have a lot of stress building up on this topic. As I do more research I keep seeing so many doomer comments regarding the IT field and all the problems with trying to break into it. I'm trying to avoid anything that is going to discourage me as I can't afford to hesitate at this point. Sunk cost fallacy and all. Anyway here's the list:

Best Skills for Cloud Engineering'

1. Networking -> Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTk5ZYSbd9Mi_ya5tVFD8NFfU1YZOyml1
2. Python
3. Docker ---> Kubernetes?
4. CI/CD Pipeline
5. Terraform

Aside from that been gradually building some momentum on my Russian study. Consistency is key...but also not being distracted just endlessly trying to optimise the best route. I've found some resources so I'm just going to chip away at them.
