Spent some time trying to come up with a daily study routine to keep myself active and productive. Up until now I had a vague idea of what I wanted to accomplish but it makes it harder to start and maintain if isn't really clear so I spent some time trying to do that. I wouldn't say it's perfect but it's a start and it's made me take some first steps. I've had a week break since my exams finished just trying to unwind and relax. Due to other life incidents it hasn't really made it as comfortable as it sounds - the free time has me dwelling on unpleasant things so I hope to minimise those occurences with this update. My rough idea looks something like this thus far:


# Peter’s Daily Coding & Growth Checklist
## Concept Study (30–60 min)
Rotate through:
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Hash Maps & Sets
- Trees & Graphs
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Big O Analysis
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- SOLID Principles
- Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.)
- Unit Testing & TDD (JUnit for Java)
- Basic System Design

## Coding Challenge (30–60 min)
Pick one problem from LeetCode, HackerRank, or GeeksforGeeks. Rotate through:
- Easy problem (warm-up)
- Medium problem (core practice)
- Hard problem (stretch goal)
- Review a past solution and refactor
- Solve with TDD

## Project Work (60–90 min)
Build your Russian Vocabulary Trainer in Java. Suggested milestones:
- Set up project structure
- Create word storage system
- Build UI (JavaFX or CLI)
- Add spaced repetition logic
- Add daily word review feature
- Add quiz mode
- Add progress tracking
- Add export/import functionality
- Write unit tests

## Russian Practice (30–60 min)
- Learn 10–20 new words
- Review past vocabulary
- Watch/listen to Russian content
- Practice grammar
- Optional: speak or write a short paragraph

## Gym (2 hrs)
- Go solo if needed
- Use music to anchor focus
- Reflect on your frame while training

## Optional: Career Prep
- Resume review/update
- LinkedIn cleanup
- Apply to 1 job or internship
- Watch 1 interview prep video
- Practice 1 behavioral question


It's not so much a checklist but more a breakdown of just things to focus on. At this stage I've decided I'll try and build a project in java to teach myself my own development process. I decided on trying to build a Russian vocab trainer to try and double up/reinforce the idea that I want to learn and practice that language as well. Not sure the details yet, maybe some kind of planning or scope will follow in the coming entrys. Either way I figure if I can slowly implement this over the next month I'll be looking a lot more productive going into the next year in tidying up my life.

I started my russian study yesterday. Just a basic 30-60 minutes going over the alphabet trying to get pronouciation correct. I've always liked the sound of it so I'm really trying to make sure I get it right. I'll watch more videos to try and get it down before moving. That's all for now.
