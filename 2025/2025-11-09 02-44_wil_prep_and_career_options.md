So as I've reduced my 'downtime' and reorganised my media to cover more industry topics I've been seeing a LOT of doomposting on the current state of 'software engineering' or 'tech' jobs online. It's pretty discouraging to read it all as I'm finishing up my degree so I'm trying to balance keeping my finger on the pulse without taking in too much negativity. I can't really give up before even trying right? With that said it's help me try and identify and structure my self learning and projects. It seems that entry level-mid level positions are quite difficult to find due to AI changes etc. This has lead me to feel that I need to specialise in areas I feel will always be needed... that simply implement that AI tools but a person still needs to be there to interpet, design and manage the systems. So far I've looked at data engineering, cloud engineering and whilst doing some research into work placements for my university capstone I came across the tech stack being asked for embedded systems design - the area that ACTUALLY interested me in school.

I read the job requirements for one company to get an idea on what kind of skills I already have and aside from basic embedded design, SDLC, version control and some JavaScript/full stack webapp development there isn't much other overlap. This has encouraged me to attempt to develop those skills though since the industry seems more promising and interesting to me. TO do this I mapped out a self study/project plan with copilot that points me in the direction of the skillset I'd need to work on. I'm not sure what the future holds over the next few months but I know I need to work on something. I decided I'm going to first go through with the python project I've posted earlier since those skills have some overlap and are transferrable. If nothing else comes up and I have time/no immediate job direction or requirement I will start to look at this secondary plan. I'll leave it here for later reference.
# C++/Linux Embedded Systems Phase Plan

This roadmap builds toward embedded systems design roles, starting after completion of the Python/data engineering app. Each phase focuses on a specific layer of the tech stack used in real-world embedded Linux jobs.

---

## Phase 1: C++ Fundamentals

**Goal**: Build fluency in modern C++ (C++11 and beyond)

**Skills**:
- Classes, inheritance, RAII
- Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)
- STL containers (`vector`, `map`, etc.)
- Lambdas and function objects

**Tools**:
- `g++` — compile C++ code
- `make` — automate builds
- `gdb` — step-by-step debugging
- `valgrind` — memory leak detection

**Crossover with Python Plan**:
- OOP & SOLID principles
- CLI design (argparse/Click)
- Logging and testing mindset

---

## Phase 2: Linux Systems Programming

**Goal**: Learn how C++ interacts with the Linux OS

**Skills**:
- File I/O (`open`, `read`, `write`)
- Threads (`pthread`, `std::thread`)
- Signals, pipes, sockets
- Process management

**Tools**:
- Linux shell (WSL, VM, or native)
- `strace`, `lsof`, `top`, `htop`

**Crossover with Python Plan**:
- Unix CLI (pipes, grep)
- Scheduling (cron)
- Logging and diagnostics

---

## Phase 3: Embedded Web Server

**Goal**: Serve a local web UI from a C++ backend

**Skills**:
- HTTP server setup (Civetweb, Mongoose)
- Serving static files (HTML, JS)
- Handling requests/responses

**Tools**:
- Lightweight C++ web server libraries

**Crossover with Python Plan**:
- Flask UI architecture
- Streamlit-style dashboards
- System design (client/server)

---

## Phase 4: Frontend UI (HTML/CSS/JS/WebGL)

**Goal**: Build a browser-based interface for device control or data visualization

**Skills**:
- HTML/CSS layout
- JavaScript interactivity
- WebGL for 3D or real-time graphics

**Tools**:
- Vanilla JS or lightweight frameworks

**Crossover with Python Plan**:
- Streamlit UI
- pandas visualizations
- Data modeling and display

---

## Phase 5: Cloud Integration

**Goal**: Send device data to a cloud backend

**Skills**:
- REST APIs (Flask, FastAPI)
- Data serialization (JSON, CSV)
- Cloud storage (S3, RDS)

**Tools**:
- Python backend
- Postgres, boto3

**Crossover with Python Plan**:
- Flask, Postgres, Docker
- ETL and pandas
- AWS S3 and RDS

---

## Phase 6: DevOps & CI/CD

**Goal**: Automate builds, tests, and deployments

**Skills**:
- Git workflows (branching, tagging)
- CMake for C++ builds
- Docker for packaging
- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

**Tools**:
- Git, Docker, CMake, CI/CD pipelines

**Crossover with Python Plan**:
- Docker and docker-compose
- pytest and unit testing
- Airflow and scheduling discipline

Aside from this I'm still just taking things one step at a time trying to get increasingly productive. I dont want to fall into the trap of endless planning but there are other issues I've been dealing with on the health & motivation front. I'm not sure the the progress is on that to be honest but hopefully it improves soon. I'm trying to schedule my time better so my brain is always occupied with something sufficiently distracting and productive. My concern is going to be burnout and mental fatigue as...my outlets have all disappeared so I need to be careful managing that. Physically I'm doing well, my gymming has been consistent and I've been improving my cardio/leg deficiencies steadily. It's been nice to see that progress so far so I hope it will continue. Will wrap it up there.
